# Adding an AI chat pop-up to Docusaurus

This uses Docusaurus and CopilotKit. The Copilot Pop-up is modified to allow it to resize as needed, and to add a reset button to reduce token use when switching conversations.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The live test [site](https://danroscigno.github.io/copilotkitdocusaurus/) is built with a GitHub workflow under `.github/workflows/`
